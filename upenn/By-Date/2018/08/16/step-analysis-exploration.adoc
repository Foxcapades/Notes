=== `PUT` `/steps/{stepId}/analyses/{analysisId}/properties`

* What are properties?
** On a text search:
*** Word enrichment had none
*** Go Enrichment had none

==== Steps

. Accepts the body as an input stream
. Retrieves StepAnalysisInstance
. Calls a setter method on a factory which takes the step analysis instance as
  well as the unchecked input stream body
.. initial setter method is just a helper that gets the ID from the analysis
   instance and calls an abstract setter method on itself
... implementation of this setter method calls a datastore setter method with an
    identical signature
.... In memory datastore just sets the properties on a map
.... Database datastore writes the input stream to the database

==== Questions/Concerns

. Why Method consumes media type text/plain?
.. What does this input look like?  Does it matter?
. Why is the setter method for properties for a StepAnalysisInstance on a
  factory and not on the StepAnalysisInstance?
