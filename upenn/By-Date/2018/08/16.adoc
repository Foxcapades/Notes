== SCRUM

=== Yesterday

* Worked on the Step Analysis `PATCH` endpoint.
** Investigated StepAnalysis classes to try and determine what is available for
   use in diffing the input data against the actual instance.  Since the input
   fields are optional it is a bit tedious.

=== Today

* Wrap up the Step Analysis `PATCH` endpoint
* Begin work on the `GET` by id endpoint

=== FUTs

* Static vs dependency injection (Mockito)
* Testing email

== Notes

* Put `PATCH` endpoint on hold.
* Explore the struts actions.
* Explore the step analysis classes, take notes, discuss with Ryan for
  confirmation of understanding.
