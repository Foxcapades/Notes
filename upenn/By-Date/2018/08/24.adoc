== Scrum

=== Yesterday

* Worked on endpoint for running a stepAnalysis
* Worked on patch endpoint
* Discussed issues found with both with Ryan

=== Today

* Wrap up endpoints, move on to XML task

=== FUTs

* Managing step analysis branch
** Don't need to maintain backwards compatibility with struts actions so I can
   potentially alter the step analysis factory without altering the interface.

== Tasks

== Notes

* Gonna hafta change the StepAnalysisFactory:
** Maybe make a validation method that is actually safe to use
** Need a way to save params without running the analysis
