== Notes

=== Step Analysis Form Param Validation

==== Questions

* [.line-through]#What is the desired workflow?# (reference workflow below)
* Why does the form param validation modify the datastore?
* Shouldn't we validate the form params _before_ running the step analysis?
* Should the set params endpoint have the separate side effect of messing with
  results/runs?
