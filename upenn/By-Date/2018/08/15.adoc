== SCRUM

=== Yesterday

* Worked with Karate, discovered some limitations that need to be discussed.
* Investigated alternatives to Karate, primarily rest-assured
* Debugged issue with the form JSON endpoint caused by a missing answer
* Orientation survey

=== Today

* Work on additional step analysis endpoints

=== Possible FUT

* Limitations with Karate
** does not use JSON schema natively
** Schema language somewhat limited in comparison to JSON schema
*** Does not support string format matching
*** Does not support any of/all of/not branching allowed by JSON schema
*** Does not easily support type matching on numbers
** JSON schema is allowed but would require code be added (may not be a deal 
   breaker, this would likely be needed if we validate input JSON)

== Notes

== Tasks

* Add troubleshooting steps to repo for vagrant scripts.
